    How it works
Create placeholders with the .placeholder class and a grid column class (e.g., .col-6) to set the width. 
They can replace the text inside an element or be added as a modifier class to an existing component.

We apply additional styling to .btns via ::before to ensure the height is respected. 
You may extend this pattern for other situations as needed, or add a   
within the element to reflect the height when actual text is rendered in its place.

 <p aria-hidden="true">
    <span class="placeholder col-6"></span>
  </p>
  <a href="#" tabindex="-1" class="btn btn-primary disabled placeholder col-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>
