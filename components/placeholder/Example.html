    Example
In the example below, we take a typical card component and recreate it with placeholders 
applied to create a "loading card". Size and proportions are the same between the two.


Flex utilities don't affect the CSS Grid columns in the same way.
Gaps replaces gutters. The gap property replaces the horizontal padding from our default grid system and functions more like margin.
As such, unlike .rows, .grids have no negative margins and margin utilities cannot be used to change the grid gutters. Grid gaps are applied horizontally and vertically by default. See the [customizing section](#customizing) for more details.
Inline and custom styles should be viewed as replacements for modifier classes (e.g., style="--bs-columns: 3;" vs class="row-cols-3").
Nesting works similarly, but may require you to reset your column counts on each instance of a nested .grid. See the [nesting section](#nesting) for details.
In the future, Bootstrap will likely shift to a hybrid solution as the gap property has achieved nearly full browser support for flexbox.
